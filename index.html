    <p>Happy birthday Nada,  </p>
    <p>ya allaaaah where do even begin, first of happy <b>*late*</b> birthday, I hope this year was good to you as inchallah every year would.
    20 years is alot of time, alot of time to spread happiness, smiles & laughter. Alot of time to create, explore and learn.
    You have grown much and I cant wait to see what the future holds for you. With all that being said, you are very late to the 20s club 
    what took you so long to grow up? Don't worry anyways, you are here now so enjoy seeing little kids calling you teta and forgetting what you were 
    looking for every 5 minutes 🤧</p>
    <p>-With love, Omar</p>
